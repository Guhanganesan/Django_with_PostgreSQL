Certainly! Let's say you have two tables: `authors` and `books`. Each author can write multiple books, and you want to get a count of books per author using an INNER JOIN along with a GROUP BY clause.

### Table Structure

**authors**
| id | name        |
|----|-------------|
| 1  | Author A   |
| 2  | Author B   |
| 3  | Author C   |

**books**
| id | title         | author_id |
|----|---------------|-----------|
| 1  | Book 1       | 1         |
| 2  | Book 2       | 1         |
| 3  | Book 3       | 2         |
| 4  | Book 4       | 3         |
| 5  | Book 5       | 2         |

### SQL Query

To get a count of books for each author, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT a.name, COUNT(b.id) AS book_count
FROM authors a
INNER JOIN books b ON a.id = b.author_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name;
```

### Explanation

1. **INNER JOIN**: This joins the `authors` table with the `books` table based on the matching `author_id`.
2. **COUNT(b.id)**: This counts the number of books for each author.
3. **GROUP BY a.id, a.name**: This groups the results by author, allowing you to get the count of books per author.

### Result

The result of this query would look like this:

| name      | book_count |
|-----------|------------|
| Author A  | 2          |
| Author B  | 2          |
| Author C  | 1          |

### Using Django ORM

If you're using Django, you can achieve the same result using the ORM like this:

```python
from django.db.models import Count
from myapp.models import Author, Book

result = Author.objects.annotate(book_count=Count('book')).values('name', 'book_count')

for entry in result:
    print(entry)
```

### Explanation of Django ORM

- **annotate**: Adds an aggregate value (`book_count`) to each author object.
- **Count('book')**: Assumes there's a related name from the `Book` model back to the `Author` model, typically done via a foreign key.
- **values**: Gets only the specified fields.

This will give you a similar output as the SQL query.
