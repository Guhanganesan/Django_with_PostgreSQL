Clickjacking is a web security vulnerability that tricks users into clicking on something different from what they perceive, 
potentially leading to unintended actions. It's often used in malicious ways to execute actions on a site on behalf of the user
without their consent.

To prevent clickjacking in a Django application, you can take several steps to protect your site. 
Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide:

# settings.py

# Add X-Frame-Options middleware to the list of middleware
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Other middleware classes...
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]

# Set the value of X-Frame-Options
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'  # Or 'SAMEORIGIN' if you need some exceptions


DENY: This setting prevents any domain from framing your content.
SAMEORIGIN: This setting allows your content to be framed only by pages from the same origin.


2. Use the Content Security Policy (CSP) Header
A Content Security Policy can provide additional protection by specifying which sources of content are allowed to be loaded on your site.
In Django, you can use the django-csp package to manage CSP headers.

First, install the package:

pip install django-csp


# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other apps...
    'csp',
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Other middleware classes...
    'csp.middleware.CSPMiddleware',
]

# Example CSP configuration to prevent framing
CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS = ["'self'"]

The CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS directive specifies which sources are allowed to frame your content. Setting it to 'self' only allows your own
domain to frame your content.

3. Avoid Framing Your Site
If possible, avoid allowing your content to be framed at all. This is the most straightforward approach to mitigating clickjacking. 
Ensure that any third-party services or applications using your content are aware of and compliant with your clickjacking prevention policies.

4. Regular Security Audits
Regularly audit your application for security vulnerabilities and ensure that your security practices are up to date. Security tools and 
services can help identify potential issues that might need addressing.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of clickjacking attacks on your Django application.
